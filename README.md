# MODL::Parser

This Ruby gem can be used as the base for a MODL interpreter. It contains the Lexer, Parser, and other supporting classes generated by the ANTLR4 Ruby language target.
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'modl'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or clone the repository and build and install it yourself as:

    $ rake install
    
    or if that fails:
    
    $ sudo rake install

You will also need to install the antlr4-ruby-runtime gem that this depends on. See https://github.com/MODLanguage/antlr4-ruby-runtime
## Usage

```ruby
require 'modl/interpreter'

result = MODL::Interpreter.interpret(str)
# or
result = MODL::Interpreter.interpret(str, true)
```
where `str` is the modl to be interpreted. The result will be a JSON string. If the second parameter is `true` then the JSON will be pretty-printed.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
